# [Next-Level React Apps With Hooks][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]

Web technologies are always changing, and React is no exception. In the last several releases of React, we have been introduced to a new way of writing components: hooks. Hooks are the new way to add features like state, lifecycle events, and refs to your components, without using the object-oriented syntax.

In this course, Derek Jensen will take you through the process of creating a brand new guest book app, from scratch, using React. As you follow along, you'll code all your entire app with functional components, and in the process you'll learn not just what Hooks are, but also how and when to use them.

## Source Files Description:
